---

## Migration Principles

### 1. User-Centric

**Always prioritize user needs over technical preferences**

- Preserve existing workflows during transition
- Provide clear migration paths
- No forced changes without user benefit
- Gradual, optional adoption of new features

**Implementation**:
```yaml
User Decides:
  - Which interface to use (AI vs. Manual)
  - When to migrate workflows
  - How to learn new features
  - Whether to keep old patterns

We Provide:
  - Both options seamlessly
  - Clear documentation
  - Migration assistance
  - Training resources
```

### 2. Incremental Delivery

**Ship value continuously, not in big-bang releases**

- Weekly releases to production
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- A/B testing of new capabilities
- Rapid iteration based on metrics

**Milestone-Based Progress**:
```yaml
Phase 1 (Foundation):
  Milestone 1: AI chat responds to simple queries
  Milestone 2: First MCP tool integrated (PostgreSQL)
  Milestone 3: AI generates basic extractor config

Phase 2 (Expansion):
  Milestone 4: AI creates complete flows
  Milestone 5: Visual flow generation from AI
  Milestone 6: Advanced transformations

Phase 3 (Integration):
  Milestone 7: AI explains existing workflows
  Milestone 8: AI optimizes performance
  Milestone 9: Full feature parity
```

### 3. Data-Driven Decisions

**Measure everything, decide based on evidence**

**Key Metrics**:
- Time to create workflow (AI vs. Manual)
- User satisfaction scores (NPS)
- Feature adoption rates
- Error rates and support tickets
- User activation and retention

**Decision Framework**:
```typescript
if (metrics.timeSavings > 50% && metrics.userSatisfaction > 4.5) {
  expandAICapabilities();
}

if (metrics.errorRate > 10% || metrics.supportTickets.increasing) {
  pauseAndIterate();
}

if (metrics.adoption < 20% after 3 months) {
  reassessApproach();
}
```

### 4. Quality Non-Negotiable

**Modern development practices from day one**

- **TypeScript**: 100% type coverage
- **Testing**: 80%+ code coverage (unit + integration)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: <100ms p95 response time
- **Security**: OWASP Top 10 compliance
- **Documentation**: Every feature documented

**Quality Gates**:
```yaml
Before Merge:
  - All tests passing
  - No TypeScript errors
  - Linting clean
  - Accessibility checks pass
  - Code reviewed by 2+ engineers

Before Production:
  - E2E tests passing
  - Performance benchmarks met
  - Security scan clean
  - Documentation updated
  - Product owner approval
```

### 5. AI Safety & Trust

**AI features must be reliable and transparent**

- **Explainability**: AI explains what it's doing and why
- **Validation**: All AI-generated configs validated
- **Manual Override**: Users can always edit manually
- **Audit Trail**: Log all AI decisions
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation if AI fails

**Trust Framework**:
```typescript
interface AIInteraction {
  // What AI is doing
  action: "Generating SQL transformation";

  // Why AI chose this approach
  reasoning: "Based on your input schema and target format...";

  // What AI will create
  preview: TransformationConfig;

  // User controls
  userOptions: {
    accept: () => void;
    edit: () => void;
    reject: () => void;
    askForAlternative: () => void;
  };

  // Audit
  auditLog: {
    timestamp: Date;
    userPrompt: string;
    aiResponse: string;
    userDecision: "accepted" | "edited" | "rejected";
  };
}
```

### 6. Preserve Business Logic

**No functionality lost in migration**

- All 49 modules' capabilities retained
- Business rules extracted and documented
- API contracts maintained
- Backward compatibility guaranteed

**Business Rule Extraction**:
```yaml
Before Any Changes:
  1. Document business rules from code
  2. Create test suite for business logic
  3. Validate with product owners
  4. Maintain rule database

Example:
  Rule: "Snowflake workspace must have valid credentials before creation"
  Tests: 15 test cases covering validation
  Documentation: docs/business-rules/workspaces.md
  Owner: Product Manager (Workspaces)
```

### 7. Team Empowerment

**Enable teams to work independently and efficiently**

- Clear ownership boundaries
- Well-defined interfaces
- Autonomous deployment
- Shared design system
- Cross-team collaboration

**Team Structure**:
```yaml
AI Track Team:
  - 2 AI/ML Engineers (prompt engineering, LLM integration)
  - 2 Backend Engineers (MCP tools, workflow engine)
  - 1 Frontend Engineer (chat UI)
  - 1 Product Manager
  - 1 Designer

Modernization Team:
  - 3 Frontend Engineers (React, TypeScript)
  - 1 Backend Engineer (API optimization)
  - 1 Product Manager
  - 1 Designer

Shared Services:

- 80% user satisfaction (NPS >50)
- 90% of common workflows automatable via AI

### Track 2: Selective Modernization

**Objective**: Fix critical issues and modernize strategic components

**Focus Areas**:
```yaml
Priority 1 - Technical Debt (Ongoing):
  - Migrate Flux stores to TanStack Query (high-impact modules)
  - Convert class components to hooks (legacy flows)
  - Remove Immutable.js (performance bottlenecks)
  - Add error boundaries (all modules)
  - Implement virtual scrolling (storage, tables)

Priority 2 - User Experience (Ongoing):
  - Improve loading states (skeleton loaders)
  - Better empty states (actionable CTAs)
  - Search improvements (fuzzy, highlighted results)
  - Mobile responsiveness (data apps, dashboard)
  - Accessibility fixes (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Priority 3 - Performance (Ongoing):
  - Bundle size optimization (code splitting)
  - React Query optimization (caching strategy)
  - API call reduction (batching, deduplication)
  - Image optimization (lazy loading)
  - Critical path CSS (faster initial load)
```

**Modules to Modernize**:
```yaml
High Priority:
  - flows-v2: Already modern, just optimize
  - storage: Add virtual scrolling, improve search
  - transformations-v2: Code editor performance
  - trash: Already excellent, use as template

Medium Priority:
  - workspaces: Improve credential management UX
  - data-apps: Better deployment feedback
  - queue: Real-time updates, better filtering

Low Priority (Wait for AI Track):
  - Legacy flows: Will be replaced by AI
  - ex-facebook: Will be AI-generated
  - Complex extractors: AI will simplify
```

**Decision Framework**:
```typescript
function shouldModernize(module: Module): boolean {
  // Don't modernize if AI will replace it
  if (module.replacedByAI && aiTrack.progress > 70%) {
    return false;
  }

  // Modernize if critical for user experience
  if (module.usage > "high" && module.userComplaints > 5) {
    return true;
  }

  // Modernize if blocking AI integration
  if (module.blockingAI) {
    return true;
  }

  // Otherwise, wait
  return false;
}
```

interface WorkflowConfig {
  // Same format regardless of creation method
  id: string;
  name: string;
  tasks: Task[];
  phases: Phase[];
  schedule?: Schedule;
  notifications?: Notification[];

  // Metadata tracks creation source
  metadata: {
    createdBy: "ai" | "manual";
    aiPrompt?: string; // If created by AI
    version: string;
  };
}

// Both UIs can edit both types of workflows
function canEdit(workflow: WorkflowConfig, user: User): boolean {
  return hasPermission(user, workflow.projectId);
  // No distinction between AI-created and manual workflows
}
```
