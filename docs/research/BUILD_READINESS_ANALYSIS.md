## ❌ What AI NEEDS (Critical Gaps)

### 1. Context & Goals (Not Wireframes!) 🎯
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY DONE

**What AI Actually Needs:**
- **User goals** - What should this screen help users achieve?
- **Context** - When/why do users need this feature?
- **Success criteria** - How do we know it works?
- **Functional requirements** - What actions can users take?
- **Design constraints** - Brand colors, spacing preferences (if any)

**What AI Doesn't Need:**
- ❌ Pixel-perfect wireframes
- ❌ Detailed mockups
- ❌ Exact component layouts
- ❌ Pre-designed UI

**Why This Works Better:**
- AI planning agents can design UI from goals
- AI understands user needs and creates appropriate UI
- Iterate on AI's design proposals
- Faster than traditional design → development
- AI can explore multiple design options

**What We Already Have:**
- ✅ User journeys documented (5 personas)
- ✅ Feature goals in feature catalog
- ✅ User workflows with context
- ✅ Existing UI as reference

**What Would Help:**
- Design tokens (colors, spacing) - optional but helpful
- Brand guidelines (if specific aesthetic required)
- Example UIs you like (for reference)

**How to Provide Context:**
```
Feature: Storage Table Browser
Goal: Let users explore data in tables quickly
Context: Users need to verify data loaded correctly
Success: Users can view sample rows, filter, search in <5 seconds
Actions: View table, sample data, search, filter, export
Constraints: Use existing design system, match current UI style
```

**Time:** Can write context for features in hours, not days

---

### 2. Quality Acceptance Criteria 🎯
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDED FOR VALIDATION

**What's Missing:**
- Performance budgets (load time, bundle size)
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA specifics)
- Browser/device support matrix
- Security requirements checklist
- Testing coverage expectations

**Why AI Needs This:**
- AI needs to know when it's "done"
- Clear acceptance criteria = better AI output
- Quality gates prevent shipping broken code
- AI can generate tests if it knows requirements

**How to Create:**
- Define performance targets (e.g., <2s TTI, <500KB bundle)
- List accessibility requirements per feature
- Specify browser versions (Chrome 90+, Safari 15+, etc.)
- Create testing checklist

**Time:** Can define in a few hours

---

### 3. Technical Decisions (Quick Setup) 🏗️
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS CLARITY

**What's Missing:**
- Repository structure decision (new repo? monorepo? branch?)
- Build tool configuration (Vite recommended)
- Deployment target (Vercel? Netlify? AWS?)
- Environment variables structure
- CI/CD preferences

**Why AI Needs This:**
- AI can set up, but needs direction on where/how
- Different platforms have different patterns
- AI can configure once you decide

**How to Create:**
- Decide: New repo or branch of existing?
- Choose: Deployment platform
- Define: Environment structure
- AI can then scaffold everything

**Time:** Decisions take minutes, AI can scaffold in minutes

---

### 4. Feature Prioritization (Already Mostly Done) ✅
**Status:** ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE

**What We Have:**
- P0-P3 feature priorities defined
- Complexity assessments done
- Quick wins identified

**What Would Help:**
- Pick specific first feature to build
- Define MVP scope (5-10 features)
- Order of implementation

**How to Use:**
- Start with 1-2 P0 features
- Let AI build incrementally
- Add features one by one

**Time:** Already done, just pick starting point

---

## 💡 AI Development Approach

### ✅ READY TO START (With Minimal Prep)

**AI Can Do:**
- Scaffold repository structure
- Configure build tools (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Generate components from specifications
- Implement routing and navigation
- Set up state management
- Write tests
- Configure CI/CD
- Deploy to production

**AI Needs From You:**
1. **Design specs** (mockups, design tokens)
2. **Decisions** (repo location, deployment platform)
3. **Acceptance criteria** (what is "good enough"?)
4. **Feedback** (iterate on AI output)

6. You approve: Move to next feature
7. Repeat

**Example:**
```
You: "Users need to see job status in real-time. Success =
      see status updates within 1 second without refreshing."

AI Plans: "I'll create a job queue dashboard with:
          - Live status updates via WebSocket
          - Color-coded status badges
          - Progress bars for running jobs
          - Expandable details on click"

AI Implements: Builds the feature

You Review: "Good! But make failed jobs more prominent"

AI Iterates: Updates design with bold failed status
```

**Your Role:**
- Review AI output
- Test functionality
- Provide feedback
- Make design decisions
- Define acceptance

**AI Role:**
- Write all code
- Configure all tools
- Generate tests
- Deploy changes
- Iterate on feedback

## 🎓 Key Insights for AI Development

### What Works Well with AI

✅ **Clear user goals** - "Users need to see job status in real-time"
✅ **Context-driven** - Explain when/why users need this
✅ **Iterative development** - Build one feature, test, refine, repeat
✅ **Success criteria** - "Users can find data in <5 seconds"
✅ **AI planning agents** - Let AI propose UI design from goals
✅ **Reference examples** - Point AI to similar UIs you like
✅ **Continuous feedback** - Fast iteration cycles

### What AI Struggles With

❌ **Vague requirements** - "Make it look good" doesn't work
❌ **No context** - Need to understand user needs
❌ **Pixel-perfect matching** - Don't expect exact wireframe replication
❌ **Complex state without guidance** - Break into smaller pieces
❌ **Novel UX without examples** - Provide references

### Maximizing AI Effectiveness

1. **Describe user goals** - What should users achieve?
2. **Provide context** - When/why do they need this?
3. **Let AI plan UI** - Don't prescribe exact layout
4. **Give examples** - "Like GitHub's PR list" or "Similar to..."
5. **Iterate on proposals** - AI shows design, you refine
6. **Provide feedback** - "Make failed jobs more prominent"
7. **Keep scope small** - One feature at a time

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You're ready to start AI development when you can answer:

- [ ] What should users achieve with this feature? (Have user goals)
- [ ] How do I know it works? (Have success criteria)
- [ ] What actions can users take? (Have functional requirements)
- [ ] Where does the code live? (Have repo decision)
- [ ] What does "good enough" look like? (Have acceptance criteria)
- [ ] What feature to build first? (Have priority)

**All YES?** → Start AI development immediately!

**Note:** You do NOT need wireframes or mockups. AI planning agents will propose UI designs based on your goals and context.

| **First Feature** | 2-3 weeks | 3-5 days |
| **MVP Timeline** | 6+ months | 4-6 weeks |
| **Cost** | $1.2M-$1.5M | $0 (your time only) |
| **Iteration Speed** | Days per change | Minutes per change |
| **Scaling** | Hire more devs | Same AI, unlimited capacity |

**AI Advantage:** 10x faster, $0 cost, infinite patience for iteration

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Status:** Ready for AI development after minimal prep

**What You Need:**
1. User goals & context for features (few hours to write)
2. Technical decisions (minutes)
3. Quality criteria (few hours)

**What You Get:**
- AI plans UI design from your goals
- AI builds entire implementation
- Iterate rapidly on AI's proposals
- MVP in 4-6 weeks
- $0 developer costs
- Full control over output

**Next Step:** Write user goals for first feature, make technical decisions, then start building with AI immediately!

---

**Recommendation:** Don't overthink it. Write goals for first feature (1 hour), pick repo location (5 minutes), let AI plan and build. Iterate from there. No wireframes needed - AI planning agents will propose UI designs.
