- Documentation reorganization

### Implementation Details

**Technology Stack (Actual):**
- Next.js 15.5.6 (upgraded from planned 14)
- React 19.2.0 (upgraded from planned 18)
- TypeScript 5.9.3
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.18
- shadcn/ui (Radix UI components)
- Lucide React 0.546.0 (icons)
- ESLint 9.38.0 (upgraded to fix deprecation)
- pnpm 10.15.0

**Features Built:**
1. **Design System** (`design-system.html`)
   - Visual preview with CSS custom properties
   - Complete color palette (Keboola blue #1F8FFF)
   - Typography scale, spacing system
   - Component examples (buttons, cards, badges)
   - Change management workflow documented

2. **Authentication** (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)
   - Stack URL dropdown (US, EU Central, Azure EU)
   - API token input with validation
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Session persistence in localStorage
   - Auto-redirect logic

3. **Dashboard** (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - 4 metric cards: Jobs, Storage, Flows, Team
   - Static preview data (ready for API integration)
   - Logout functionality
   - Responsive layout

4. **API Client** (`src/lib/api/auth.ts`)
   - Type-safe authentication utilities
   - Stack URL definitions
   - Token validation against Storage API
   - Ready for TanStack Query integration

5. **Developer Tools**
   - Makefile with common commands (`make dev`, `make build`, etc.)
   - Design system preview workflow
   - Build verification

### Key Decisions

- ✅ **Design System Workflow**: Single source of truth with automated sync
  - `design-system.html` = source of truth (never edit globals.css directly!)
  - `make sync-design` = automated sync to `src/app/globals.css`
  - `scripts/sync-design-tokens.js` = extracts & propagates CSS custom properties
  - Change workflow: Edit design-system.html → Run sync → Restart dev server
- ✅ CSS Custom Properties as design tokens (93 tokens total)
- ✅ Documentation reorganized into build-specs/, implementation/, research/
- ✅ Comprehensive usage guides to ensure research is actively used
- ✅ Latest stable versions (Next.js 15, React 19) for future-proofing
- ✅ Dashboard spec updated to match actual implementation (777 lines)

### Challenges Solved

1. **Design System Change Management**
   - Created two-tier system: `design-system.html` (preview) + `globals.css` (implementation)
   - CSS custom properties ensure changes propagate automatically
   - Documented workflow for design updates

2. **ESLint Deprecation Warning**
   - Upgraded from ESLint 8 → 9
   - Upgraded Next.js 14 → 15, React 18 → 19
   - All dependencies on latest stable versions

3. **Research Accessibility**
   - Moved old UI research under `docs/research/legacy-ui/`
   - Created comprehensive usage guides with practical examples
   - Quick reference tables linking features to research files

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Resolved autoprefixer dependency issue
   - Fixed CSS syntax errors (border-border, bg-background)
   - Configured Tailwind with design tokens

**Key Files Created:**
- design-system.html (design system preview)
- src/app/login/page.tsx (authentication)
- src/app/dashboard/page.tsx (dashboard)
- src/lib/api/auth.ts (API utilities)
- Makefile (dev workflow)

2. Limited self-service for non-technical users → AI workflows
3. Debugging complexity → AI assistance
4. Information overload → Progressive disclosure

**Journey Times (Current → AI-Accelerated Target):**
- New pipeline creation: 65 min → 6 min
- Ad-hoc analysis: 43 min → 4 min
- dbt deployment: 55 min → 10 min
- Self-service access: 22 min → 2 min

### Feature Prioritization

**P0 Must-Have (35 features, 92 weeks):**
- Core data integration (extractors/writers)
- Flow builder & orchestration
- Storage management
- Transformations
- Authentication & RBAC

**Quick Wins (20 features, 30 weeks):**
