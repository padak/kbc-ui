  - Task grouping by phase
  - Dependency arrows
  - Visual feedback during generation

Interactive Editing:

  - Hybrid editing (some manual, some AI)

Visual Explanations:
  - AI explains what each task does
  - Highlight task when AI mentions it
  - Show data flow between tasks
  - Explain why dependencies exist
```

**Code Example**:
```typescript
// AI-Generated Flow to React Flow Nodes
import { type Node, type Edge } from 'reactflow';

function generateFlowVisualization(
  aiWorkflow: AIWorkflowConfig
): { nodes: Node[]; edges: Edge[] } {
  const nodes: Node[] = [];
  const edges: Edge[] = [];

  // Convert tasks to nodes
  aiWorkflow.tasks.forEach((task, index) => {
    nodes.push({
      id: task.id,
      type: task.type, // 'extractor', 'transformation', 'writer'
      position: calculatePosition(index, aiWorkflow.tasks.length),
      data: {
        label: task.name,
        config: task.config,
        aiGenerated: true,
        aiExplanation: task.aiReasoning,
      },
    });

    // Add edges for dependencies
    task.dependencies.forEach(depId => {
      edges.push({
        id: `${depId}-${task.id}`,
        source: depId,
        target: task.id,
        animated: true, // Show data flow
      });
    });
  });

  return { nodes, edges };
}

// Bidirectional sync
function syncFlowChanges(
  source: 'canvas' | 'ai',
  changes: FlowChange[]
) {
  if (source === 'canvas') {
    // User edited on canvas, update AI context
    updateAIContext(changes);
  } else {
    // AI modified flow, update canvas
    updateReactFlow(changes);
  }
}
```

**Module Integration**:
```yaml
Existing Module: flows-v2
  Current: React Flow with manual building
  Enhanced: AI generates initial structure
  Benefit: 10x faster flow creation

  User Journey:
    1. Describe flow in chat
    2. AI generates and shows canvas
    3. User makes minor tweaks on canvas
    4. Both interfaces stay synced

  Reference:
    - Code: docs/02-modules/flows-v2.md
    - UX: docs/05-workflows/03-flow-creation-execution.md

  - Best practice enforcement
  - Incremental loading setup
  - Error handling improvements

AI Debugging:
  - User: "This flow failed, why?"
  - AI: Analyzes error logs

```

**User Workflow Example**:
```
User: "This flow is running slow, can you help?"

AI: "I've analyzed your flow 'Daily Sales Pipeline'. Here's what I found:

     Performance Issues:
     1. Task 3 (SQL Transformation) does a full table scan
        - Suggestion: Add index on order_date column
        - Estimated speedup: 5x

     2. Task 1 (MySQL Extractor) loads 10M rows every run
        - Suggestion: Use incremental loading
        - Estimated speedup: 20x, cost reduction: 90%

     3. Task 5 (BigQuery Writer) writes to partitioned table incorrectly
        - Suggestion: Use date column for partitioning
        - Estimated speedup: 2x, cost reduction: 50%

     Would you like me to apply these optimizations? [Yes] [Show Details] [Manual Edit]"
```

**Success Criteria**:
