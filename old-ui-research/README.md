# Old UI Research Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive research and documentation of the **original Keboola Connection UI**.

## Purpose

This documentation was created to:
- Understand the existing UI architecture and features
- Inform the design and development of the **new UI** (being built from scratch)
- Serve as reference material for feature parity and migration planning

## What's Inside

- **01-overview/** - Architecture, tech stack, routing, state management
- **02-modules/** - Detailed analysis of all 49 modules (extractors, writers, flows, etc.)
- **03-features/** - Feature catalog (121 features), complexity assessments, user journeys
- **04-components/** - Design system components from the old UI
- **05-workflows/** - User workflows with screenshots
- **06-api-contracts/** - API clients and integration patterns
- **07-state-management/** - State management patterns and migration guides
- **08-screenshots/** - UI screenshots from the old system
- **09-migration-plan/** - Strategic migration and modernization plans

## Documentation Method

Created using parallel AI agents analyzing the original codebase:
- **Phase 2**: 17 agents analyzing code (71 files, ~34,552 lines)
- **Phase 3**: UI exploration with Playwright (4 workflows, 12 screenshots)
- **Phase 4**: Synthesis and migration planning (17 files, ~16,719 lines)

## For Reference Only

⚠️ **Important**: This documents the OLD UI. The new UI is being built from scratch in the main project directory.
